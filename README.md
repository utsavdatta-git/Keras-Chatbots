# keras_chatbots
  
Chatbots (Chat-oriented Conversational Agent) are designed to handle full conversations, mimicking the unstructured flow of a human to human conversation. In this project, I have tried to implement a basic (chit-chat) chatbot using Sequence to Sequence (seq2seq) model and Word Embeddings (Glove). First, I have created a baseline model using a Sequential keras model with a bi-directional LSTM layer. Then, I improved on it using a seq2seq model architecture and fastText word embeddings.

# Datasets

https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-PersonalityChat/tree/master/CSharp/Datasets

# Training

Running the notebook sequentially will take care of the preprocessing, training and testing (at the end).

# Pre-trainied models

Alternatively, pre-trained models of the seq2seq architecture are also provided.
